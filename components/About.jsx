            Being full of energy Iâ€™m looking for employment in IT industry as a
            Web Developer. Having genuine interest in IT began exploring deeply
            that area couple years ago to make a career change. Aiming to
            achieve sufficient foundation to become a professional I graduated
            at TAFE South Bank with Diploma in Web Development in Jul 2022 where
            I gained hands-on experience with ReactJS, NodeJS, Git/GitHub, Data
            Structures, APIs, SQL and non SQL (MongoDB) databases, Drupal,
            Wordpress, Bootstrap and tech principles and culture via both
            team/individual projects, code reviews and presentations.
